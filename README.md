## Demo

![Demo](docs/demo.gif)

**AgentForge** is an open-source WhatsApp AI platform for service businesses. It gives you a reusable host runtime for WhatsApp messaging, agent orchestration, MCP tool execution, and Aspire-based local deployment — while letting each industry vertical plug in its own tools, prompts, workflows, and data.

The current in-tree vertical is **travel** (`AgentForge.Verticals.Travel`), which acts as both:

- the working reference implementation
- the first commercial wedge
- the example of how AgentForge can later extend into industries such as salons, clinics, restaurants, or other service businesses

Today, you can clone the repo, configure the secrets, and run the travel experience end to end. Under the hood, though, the architecture is already oriented around **dynamic vertical plugins**, not a permanently travel-only codebase.

### Message Flow (step by step)

1. Customer sends a WhatsApp message to the business number
2. OpenWA receives it and POSTs a webhook to the public DevTunnel URL
3. `AgentForge.WebApi` verifies the OpenWA HMAC signature and enqueues the message into a bounded `Channel<T>`
4. `WhatsAppMessageQueue` dequeues and calls `AgentChatService`
5. `AgentChatService` restores the customer's conversation session (in-memory, keyed by phone number)
6. `VerticalAgentFactory` initializes the agent using the active vertical descriptor and prompt
7. `AgentForge.McpHost` loads tools/resources from the selected vertical assembly and executes requested MCP calls
8. The active vertical shapes the conversation behavior, available tools, preview metadata, and scheduled action handling
9. `OpenWaApiClient` delivers the WhatsApp-friendly reply back through OpenWA

Alongside the live chat, `SchedulerService` dispatches generic scheduled actions to the active vertical's `IScheduledActionHandler` implementation.

## Dynamic MCP Tool Wiring

`AgentForge.McpHost` is a **generic MCP host**. It does not permanently own travel logic anymore. Instead:

1. a vertical plugin exposes an `IVerticalPlugin`
2. that plugin exposes an `IVerticalMcpRegistrar`
3. the registrar points the host at the assembly containing the vertical's tools/resources
4. `AgentForge.McpHost` registers those tools/resources at runtime

The current shipped vertical is `src/Verticals/AgentForge.Verticals.Travel/`, so the live toolset below is the **travel example vertical**, not the hard limit of the platform.

### Current travel vertical tools

|---|---|---|
| **Tour Search** | `search_tours` | Search by destination, keyword, budget, or travel month |
| | `get_tour_details` | Full tour details — highlights, inclusions, exclusions, reviews |
| | `check_availability` | Remaining slots for a tour in a given month |
| | `get_pricing_breakdown` | Detailed cost breakdown by room type (single/double/triple) |
| **Booking** | `create_booking_inquiry` | Register a customer booking inquiry with all details |
| | `get_customer_inquiries` | Retrieve a customer's existing inquiries by phone number |
| **Post-Booking** | `get_day_by_day_itinerary` | Day-by-day travel program |
| | `get_departure_checklist` | Documents, health prep, and day-of instructions |
| | `submit_trip_feedback` | Collect a star rating and comment after the trip |
| | `get_tour_reviews` | Customer reviews and average rating for a tour |

## How AgentForge Extends to Other Industries

This repository is now structured so the **host runtime stays generic** while each industry vertical owns its own domain behavior.

### Generic platform pieces

- `AgentForge.AppHost` — Aspire orchestration, secrets, OpenWA resources, DevTunnel, MCP Inspector, Compose publish flow
- `AgentForge.WebApi` — webhook handling, session management, queueing, agent execution, OpenWA sending
- `AgentForge.McpHost` — generic MCP host that loads tools/resources from the active vertical
- `AgentForge.Verticals.Abstractions` — shared plugin contracts such as `IVerticalPlugin`, `IVerticalDescriptor`, `IVerticalMcpRegistrar`, and `IScheduledActionHandler`
- `AgentForge.Verticals.Hosting` — default and `AssemblyLoadContext`-based plugin loaders

### Vertical-owned pieces

Each vertical can own:

- runtime config packs, prompts, and branding
- MCP tools and MCP resources
- domain services/models
- industry seed data
- scheduled action behavior
- WebApi service registrations specific to that industry

### Current plugin contract

At a high level, a vertical plugs in by implementing:

- `IVerticalDescriptor` — runtime-composed display name, agent metadata, system prompt, preview defaults, asset prefix
- `IVerticalMcpRegistrar` — which assembly contains the vertical's MCP tools/resources and which services to register for MCP
- `IVerticalPlugin` — configuration sources, common services, runtime descriptor creation, MCP registrar, and WebApi service registration
- `IScheduledActionHandler` — industry-specific reminder/follow-up behavior

### Runtime selection model

AgentForge supports three runtime modes today:

1. **Default fallback** — if no plugin env vars are set, both hosts use the in-tree travel plugin
2. **Direct path** — set `VERTICAL_PLUGIN_PATH` to an external plugin folder or DLL
3. **Plugin root + id** — set `VERTICAL_PLUGIN_ROOT` and `VERTICAL_ID` so the loader resolves `<root>/<id>`

### Creating a new industry vertical

To add a new industry such as salon, clinic, or restaurant:

1. create a new class library under `src/Verticals/AgentForge.Verticals.<Vertical>/`
2. implement the vertical descriptor, MCP registrar, plugin entry point, and scheduled action handler
3. place that vertical's tools/resources/services/data in the new assembly
4. publish it to `artifacts/plugins/<vertical-id>/`
5. point `VERTICAL_PLUGIN_PATH` or `VERTICAL_PLUGIN_ROOT` + `VERTICAL_ID` at it

The result is the same generic WhatsApp host runtime with a different business-specific capability set loaded at runtime.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) | 10.0+ | `dotnet --version` to verify |
| [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) | Latest | Required to run the OpenWA API/dashboard plus provider-side Postgres/Redis |
| [Aspire CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/aspire-sdk-tooling) | 13.3+ | `dotnet tool install -g aspire` |
| [Azure DevTunnel CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started) | Latest | `devtunnel user login` before running |
| [Azure AI Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/) | — | Deployed GPT-5.4 mini (or compatible model) |
| OpenWA API Key | — | Any string — you set this yourself in secrets |

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/goldytech/whatsapp-ai-travel-agent.git
cd whatsapp-ai-travel-agent
```

### 2. Configure secrets

All sensitive values are stored in .NET user secrets (never committed to source control).

```bash
# Set OpenWA credentials (choose your own values)
cd src/AgentForge.AppHost
dotnet user-secrets set "Parameters:openWaApiKey"          "your-api-key"
dotnet user-secrets set "Parameters:openWaEncryptionKey"   "generate-a-long-random-secret"
dotnet user-secrets set "Parameters:openWaWebhookSecret"   "generate-a-second-long-random-secret"
dotnet user-secrets set "Parameters:openWaPostgresPassword" "set-a-strong-database-password"

# Set Azure AI Foundry connection string
# Format: Endpoint=https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/models;Key=<key>
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:ai-foundry" "Endpoint=https://...;Key=...;"
```

> **Tip:** `openWaApiKey` protects the OpenWA REST API. `openWaWebhookSecret` is a separate shared secret used for OpenWA's HMAC-signed webhook delivery to `/webhook`. Keep them different.

### 3. Log in to DevTunnel

```bash
devtunnel user login
```

### 4. Start the application

```bash
aspire start
```

Aspire will:
- Pull and start the OpenWA API/dashboard plus provider-side Postgres/Redis containers
- Start `AgentForge.McpHost` and `AgentForge.WebApi`
- Create a DevTunnel and register the webhook URL with OpenWA automatically

Open the Aspire Dashboard link printed in the terminal to monitor all services.

### 5. Connect WhatsApp (scan QR)

Follow the **OpenWA Dashboard Configuration** section below to link your WhatsApp account.

---

## OpenWA Dashboard Configuration

OpenWA exposes a management dashboard to connect your WhatsApp account.

### Access the dashboard

1. In the Aspire Dashboard, find the **openwa-dashboard** container resource
2. Click the **OpenWA Dashboard** link (opens `http://localhost:<port>/`)
3. If the UI prompts for API access, enter the `openWaApiKey` you configured in secrets

### Create and start a session

1. Open or create the `default` session (the code uses this session name)
2. Start or resume the session if it is not already active

### Link your WhatsApp account

1. Once status reaches `SCAN_QR`, click the QR icon
2. On your phone: **WhatsApp → Linked Devices → Link a Device**
3. Scan the QR code
4. Status changes to `CONNECTED` — your bot is live ✅

### Session persistence

The API container uses a **Persistent lifetime** in Aspire, meaning it survives `aspire stop` / `aspire start` cycles. The OpenWA session data is stored in a Docker volume (`openwa-data`). On restarts, `WebhookRegistrationService` automatically re-registers the webhook and reconciles the `default` session state.

> **Troubleshooting:** If the session shows `DISCONNECTED` or `STOPPED`, the service attempts a restart on the next `aspire start`. You can also trigger it manually via the OpenWA dashboard.

### Webhook authenticity

OpenWA webhooks are configured with an HMAC secret and `AgentForge.WebApi` verifies every `/webhook` request against the raw request body before any JSON is parsed.

- OpenWA sends `X-OpenWA-Signature`
- The app currently expects the standard `sha256=<hex>` signature format
- Invalid or unsigned webhook requests are rejected before they reach the message queue

The manual `POST /admin/register-webhook` endpoint is available in **Development** only.

---

## MCP Inspector

The [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) is a browser-based developer tool for interactively exploring and testing the tools and resources exposed by `AgentForge.McpHost`. It is included automatically in the Aspire application when running locally — no separate install required.

### Open the inspector

1. Run `aspire start` and open the **Aspire Dashboard** link printed in the terminal
2. Find the **mcp-inspector** resource and click its **Client** endpoint link
3. The inspector opens in your browser at `http://localhost:6274`

### Connect to the MCP server

1. In the **Transport Type** dropdown, select **Streamable HTTP**
2. The **Server URL** field will be pre-filled with the local `AgentForge.McpHost` endpoint (e.g. `http://localhost:<port>/mcp`)
3. Click **Connect**, then click **Initialize**
4. You can now browse all **18 tools** and **3 resources** — execute them with custom arguments and inspect the responses in real time

### Node.js v24 compatibility note

The default inspector version (`0.17.2`) crashes on Node.js v24+ with `ERR_INVALID_STATE: Controller is already closed`. The AppHost pins the inspector to `0.17.5` which includes the fix:

```csharp
// AgentForge.AppHost/AppHost.cs
builder.AddMcpInspector("mcp-inspector", options =>
{
    options.InspectorVersion = "0.17.5";
}).WithMcpServer(mcpServer);
```

If you upgrade the `CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.McpInspector` package in the future, verify the bundled default version is `0.17.5` or later before removing the explicit pin.

---

## Configuration Reference

Secrets stay in AppHost user secrets. Customer-facing branding, prompt text, and business-profile settings can be layered from a mounted config folder without recompiling the travel plugin.

Aspire parameters are used for **promptable runtime inputs**. Graph-shaping AppHost values stay as ordinary configuration so the resource graph can be built deterministically before the dashboard starts.

| Secret / Env Var | Where set | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Parameters:openWaApiKey` | `AgentForge.AppHost` user secrets | API key protecting the OpenWA REST endpoints |
| `Parameters:openWaEncryptionKey` | `AgentForge.AppHost` user secrets | Provider-side encryption key for OpenWA runtime data |
| `Parameters:openWaWebhookSecret` | `AgentForge.AppHost` user secrets | Shared secret used by OpenWA to HMAC-sign webhook POST bodies |
| `Parameters:openWaPostgresPassword` | `AgentForge.AppHost` user secrets | Password for the Aspire-managed PostgreSQL instance used by OpenWA |
| `ConnectionStrings:ai-foundry` | `AgentForge.AppHost` user secrets | Azure AI Foundry connection string (`Endpoint=...;Key=...`) |
| `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` | Optional env var on `AgentForge.WebApi` | Override the webhook URL if not using DevTunnel |
| `OPENWA_DASHBOARD_HOST_PORT` | Optional env var on published Compose deployments | Host port exposing the OpenWA dashboard (`2886` by default) |
| `VERTICAL_ID` | Optional env var on `AgentForge.AppHost` | Active vertical ID for Compose publishing and runtime selection (`travel` by default) |
| `VERTICAL_PLUGIN_ROOT` | Optional env var on `AgentForge.AppHost` | Container-side root path mounted into `AgentForge.WebApi` and `AgentForge.McpHost` during Compose publish (`/app/plugins` by default) |
| `VERTICAL_PLUGIN_SOURCE_PATH` | Optional env var on `AgentForge.AppHost` | Host-side plugin folder to bind-mount during Compose publish (defaults to `../../artifacts/plugins/{VERTICAL_ID}` relative to `src/AgentForge.AppHost/`) |
| `CUSTOMER_CONFIG_SOURCE_PATH` | Optional env var on `AgentForge.AppHost` | Host-side customer config folder to bind-mount during Compose publish; when set, the AppHost also passes `CUSTOMER_CONFIG_PATH` into both hosts |
| `CUSTOMER_CONFIG_PATH` | Optional env var on `AgentForge.WebApi` / `AgentForge.McpHost` | Path to a customer config folder containing `customer-profile.json` and optionally `prompt.md`; when unset, the travel plugin falls back to its bundled defaults |
| `VERTICAL_PLUGIN_PATH` | Optional env var on `AgentForge.WebApi` / `AgentForge.McpHost` | Path to an external published vertical plugin folder or DLL; when unset, the in-tree travel plugin is used |

### Optional dashboard local overrides

When you run `aspire start` locally, the AppHost exposes these as Aspire parameters:

- `vertical-plugin-path` — optional local override for an external plugin folder or DLL
- `customer-config-path` — optional local override for a customer config folder

They default to blank, so local startup no longer blocks on unresolved parameters. Blank means:

- built-in in-tree travel plugin
- bundled travel customer config

If you want to preconfigure these overrides without using the dashboard, the canonical Aspire parameter keys are `Parameters:vertical-plugin-path` and `Parameters:customer-config-path`. For env-style configuration, the AppHost also accepts these shell-friendly aliases:

- `Parameters__vertical_plugin_path`
- `Parameters__customer_config_path`

Legacy `VERTICAL_PLUGIN_PATH` and `CUSTOMER_CONFIG_PATH` environment variables are still accepted as compatibility fallbacks for local runs.

The dashboard parameters are therefore an **optional override UX**, not a required setup step. In contrast, values like `VERTICAL_ID`, `VERTICAL_PLUGIN_SOURCE_PATH`, and `CUSTOMER_CONFIG_SOURCE_PATH` still shape the AppHost graph or publish output, so they remain standard AppHost configuration rather than dashboard-entered parameters.

### Customer config pack layout

The bundled travel defaults now live under:

```text
src/Verticals/AgentForge.Verticals.Travel/Configuration/
├── customer-profile.json
└── prompt.md
```

To onboard a customer without recompiling, mount a folder with the same shape and point `CUSTOMER_CONFIG_PATH` at it:

```text
customer-config/
├── customer-profile.json
└── prompt.md   # optional override; falls back to the bundled prompt if omitted
```

`customer-profile.json` is bound through the .NET Options pattern, so branding, MCP server name, preview text, lead-capture fields, capabilities, business hours, and handoff rules are strongly typed and validated on startup.

---

## Customising the Current Travel Vertical

### Replace the tour catalog

Edit the JSON data files in `src/Verticals/AgentForge.Verticals.Travel/Data/`:

- `TourCatalog.json` — tour packages (name, destination, duration, price, tags, highlights)
- `DestinationGuide.json` — destination guides (best season, visa, packing, attractions)
- `AgencyInfo.json` — cancellation tiers, group discounts, contact info
- `FAQ.json` — frequently asked questions
- `Promotions.json` — active promotional offers and discounts

### Change the AI persona

Edit the bundled config pack in `src/Verticals/AgentForge.Verticals.Travel/Configuration/`:

- `customer-profile.json` — display name, agent metadata, MCP server name, preview defaults, lead-capture fields, capabilities, business hours, handoff rules
- `prompt.md` — the long-form travel system prompt template

For customer onboarding, prefer an external folder plus `CUSTOMER_CONFIG_PATH` so you do not need to recompile the plugin.

### Add new MCP tools

1. Create a new `*Tools.cs` class in `src/Verticals/AgentForge.Verticals.Travel/Tools/` decorated with `[McpServerToolType]`
2. Add `[McpServerTool]` methods — they are auto-registered via `WithToolsFromAssembly`
3. Inject any services you need through the constructor — standard DI applies

No changes needed in `AgentForge.WebApi` — the agent discovers new tools on startup.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. **Open an issue** first to discuss the change (bug, feature, or improvement)
2. **Fork** the repository and create a branch:
   ```
   git checkout -b feat/<issue-number>-short-description
   ```
3. Make your changes following the existing code style:
   - C# 14 features where appropriate (`field`-backed properties, extension members, `System.Threading.Lock`, collection expressions, etc.)
   - Primary constructors for services
   - `ConfigureAwait(false)` on all `await` calls in library/service code
   - No `#pragma warning disable` — fix the root cause instead
4. **Build and verify** with `dotnet build` (zero warnings expected)
5. Open a **Pull Request** — reference the issue in the PR description

### Code style highlights

- Services are registered as `Singleton` or `Scoped` — never `Transient` for stateful classes
- HTTP clients use `IHttpClientFactory` (typed or named) — no `new HttpClient()`
- Background work uses `Channel<T>` or `IHostedService` — no `_ = Task.Run(...)`
- Retries are intentionally disabled on `OpenWaApiClient` — retrying a send request can produce duplicate WhatsApp messages
